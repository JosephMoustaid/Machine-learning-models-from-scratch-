# Machine Learning models from scratch
<p>So after learning ML model, I have felt still my understanding is still poor of those models, I can use them and I have knowledge on the specific use cases of each one , but never understood them as well</p>
<bold>To learn the machine learning models to a great level,and to understand fully how each model works, I thought it's imprtant to implment each model with the boring math behind it.</bold>
<bold>This approach made me learn the machine learning models to a great level ,I can confidently say I know how each of those models work</bold>
<h4>Huge thanks to @AssemblyAI for their amazing work, you can check their youtube chanel, they provided the base for me through their playlist called "Machine learning from scratch with python"</h4>
